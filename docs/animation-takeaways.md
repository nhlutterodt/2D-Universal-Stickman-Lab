# 2D Universal Stickman Lab ‚Äî Key Takeaways and Next Steps

This document summarizes the most relevant concepts from the research to inform our ongoing work in the 2D Universal Stickman Lab editor and animation system.

---

## 1. Modular Skeletal Architecture

- **Hierarchical Bone Tree**: Represent each bone as a node with references to parent and children. Transformations cascade down the tree for Forward Kinematics (FK).
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: `SkeletonEditor` and `ImprovedSkeletonEditor` store bones in a `Map`, allow add/delete/select, and render a flat bone list.
- Missing: Explicit parent‚Äìchild relationships and cascading FK transforms (bones have no parent field or recursive updateWorldTransform in code).

## 2. Mathematical Utilities & Optimizations

- **Vector/Matrix Primitives**: Implement custom `Vector2` and `Matrix3` classes for position, rotation, and scale‚Äîavoid external dependencies to satisfy ‚Äúpure JS‚Äù.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: A simple `Vector2` class in `index.html` for position handling.
- Missing: `Matrix3` or equivalent transform utilities; no typed arrays or engine optimizations in math-intensive loops.

## 3. Forward & Inverse Kinematics

- **FK Update**: Recursively compute `bone.worldRotation = parent.worldRotation + bone.localRotation` and endpoint via `x += length * cos(Œ∏)`, `y += length * sin(Œ∏)`.
- **IK Solvers**:
  - **Analytical 2-Bone**: Law-of-Cosines solution for 2-segment limbs (constant time, ideal for arms/legs).
  - **FABRIK**: Forward/backward reaching iterative solver‚Äîfaster convergence than CCD for longer chains.
  - **CCD**: Simple iterative solver for arbitrary chain lengths, but watch iteration count to avoid stalls.
- **Constraints Integration**: Enforce joint limits during solving rather than post-clamping to avoid snapping artifacts.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: Basic drawing of bones in `renderPreview` with length, rotation, position per bone.
- Missing: No dedicated FK chain update method; no IK solver implementations (CCD/FABRIK/analytical) or constraint-aware solving.

## 4. Robust Constraint System

- **Soft vs. Hard Limits**: Integrate constraints into the IK iteration (soft springs) to produce natural motion under angle limits.
- **Bend Direction**: Support preferred bending arcs (e.g., elbow should not fold backwards) and visualize them in the authoring UI.
- **Dynamic Reach Handling**: When a target is out-of-reach, gracefully stretch bones along the chain rather than abruptly clamping.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: Name validation and basic property clamping (min/max sliders) for bone properties.
- Missing: Joint constraint logic in animation or solving algorithms; no UI visualization for limits.

## 5. Animation State & Blending

- **State Machine**: Layer keyframe, procedural (IK, combat, locomotion), and physics-driven motions via a blend graph.
- **History Recording**: Already tracking undo/redo; extend to record time-series of bone metrics for post-analysis and graphing.
- **Curve Export**: Provide JSON export of recorded metrics (`length`, `rotation`, `x`, `y` over time) for external tooling.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: Undo/redo history via `History` class; graph data recording and export implemented.
- Missing: Blend graph UI or state machine; keyframe/ procedural animation layering framework.

## 6. Performance & Rendering

- **Canvas vs. WebGL**: Current 2D canvas is sufficient; consider batched draw calls and layering for complex scenes.
- **Grid & Unit Scaling**: Grid snapping at configurable size; label units in UI pane for consistent measurement.
- **Profiling**: Use DevTools Performance benchmarks to identify bottlenecks‚Äîfocus on FK, IK, and render loops.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: Canvas rendering with zoom/pan, grid toggle, throttled inputs, `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Missing: WebGL fallback or high-performance batching; built-in profiling/logging hooks for render and math loops.

## 7. Graph Pane Integration

- **Real-Time Charts**: Use Chart.js in a `<graph-pane>` Web Component to plot averaged bone metrics live.
- **Controls**: Add playback scrubber or time slider to replay recorded graph history.
- **Export & Analysis**: Wire up JSON export and provide hooks (events) for future algorithmic analysis within the editor.
**Current Status in Workspace:**
- Present: `<graph-pane>` component renders live charts and exports graph data.
- Missing: Time-scrubber control, axis unit labels, and history playback UI in the component.

## 8. UI/UX Enhancements to Implement

Based on our current workspace gaps, we should expand the following user-facing features:

- **Interactive Graph Controls**:
  - Add time-scrubber and playback buttons in `<graph-pane>` to scroll through recorded metrics.
  - Display axis labels (units, time, value) and allow zoom/pan of the chart.
  - Provide tooltips on hover for data points (e.g. bone length at time t).

- **Blend Graph UI**:
  - Visual editor for blending keyframe and procedural layers (node-based interface).
  - Easy toggles to enable/disable IK, FK, and procedural tracks, with real-time preview.

- **Constraint Visualization**:
  - Overlay joint limits on the canvas (arcs or shaded regions) when a bone is selected.
  - Interactive handles to adjust min/max angles directly on the skeleton.

- **Bone Hierarchy Panel**:
  - Tree view of bones with drag-and-drop reparenting.
  - Inline editing of bone names, colors, and visibility.

- **Contextual Grid & Units**:
  - Show coordinate axes and unit labels on the canvas overlay (e.g. cm, px).
  - Toggle grid snapping size and display current grid spacing in the UI.

- **Enhanced Tooltips & Help**:
  - Dynamic tooltips for all controls (sliders, buttons), updated on locale changes.
  - A context-sensitive help pane that explains shortcuts and features inline.

*Prioritize the graph controls first, then progressively layer in blend graph, constraints, and hierarchy panels.*

## 9. Required Modular Systems and Architecture

To support current and future UI/UX features, our codebase must expose clearly separated systems:

- **Math Core Module**
  - Responsibilities: `Vector2`, `Matrix3`, numeric utilities, typed-array wrappers.
  - Modularity: Export as a standalone library used by FK/IK, rendering, and graph updates.

- **Skeleton & FK Engine**
  - Responsibilities: Bone data structures (with parent/child), `updateWorldTransform` recursion, grid snapping.
  - Modularity: Provide a `Skeleton` class API for UI panes and solvers to query/modify bone hierarchy.

- **IK & Constraints Engine**
  - Responsibilities: Analytical, FABRIK, CCD solvers; joint limit enforcement; bend bias.
  - Modularity: Expose solver interfaces (`solveChain`, `applyConstraints`) so the blend graph and tool panels can plug in.

- **Animation State & Blend Graph**
  - Responsibilities: Manage layers of keyframe, procedural, and physics tracks; output target `Skeleton` poses.
  - Modularity: Node-based graph data model, with runtime API to connect solver outputs and feed into render loop.

- **Render Module**
  - Responsibilities: Canvas draw calls, grid, axes, skeleton overlay, constraint visualization.
  - Modularity: Accept a `Skeleton` instance and UI flags (showGrid, showLimits, zoom/pan) as inputs.

- **Graph Data & Visualization Module**
  - Responsibilities: Time-series data capture, Chart.js integration, scrubber controls, export events.
  - Modularity: Web Component `<graph-pane>` that subscribes to data events and updates chart.

- **UI Framework Layer**
  - Responsibilities: Tool palette, property panels, hierarchy tree, blend graph editor.
  - Modularity: Each pane as a self-contained Web Component or module, communicating via events and shared context.

*By delineating these modules and defining clear APIs between them, we can independently develop and test each system while ensuring they integrate seamlessly to power our evolving UI/UX.*

## Next Steps

1. Expand math utilities with optimized `Vector2` and `Matrix3` operations.
2. Integrate soft constraint handling directly into FABRIK and CCD solvers.
3. Build blend graph UI to layer keyframe and procedural animations.
4. Refine graph-pane controls (scrubber, axis labels, unit scaling).
5. Benchmark FK/IK loops and optimize hot paths (typed arrays or WASM).
6. Plug Math Core into Skeleton & IK
   - Move `Vector2` into `math/vector.ts` with full operations
   - Create `Matrix3` in `math/matrix.ts` for 2D transforms
   - Refactor Skeleton, IK, and render modules to import from math core
   - Apply via constructor injection or direct import to minimize surface changes

üîç Validation Prompt: ‚ÄúProfile FK update loop with DevTools‚Äîdo transform ops use math module and avoid allocations?‚Äù

### üîπ Prompt: Connect FABRIK Solver with Skeleton and UI Constraints

**Assumptions:**
- FABRIK solver implemented in `ik/solvers/fabrik.ts`
- Bone angle limits defined via UI (min/max sliders)
- Skeleton supports parent‚Äìchild hierarchy

**Goal:** Integrate FABRIK solver with real-time Skeleton data, applying soft constraints from bone properties

**Structure:**
- Implement `solveFABRIK(boneChain: Bone[], target: Vector2)` in `ik/solvers/fabrik.ts`
- Enforce `minAngle`/`maxAngle` and bend preference during each iteration step
- Wire UI slider events (`property-panel.ts`) to update `Bone.minAngle`/`maxAngle`
- Trigger solver on IK target drag and update `Skeleton` transforms

**Example:**
```ts
let angle = computeAngle(prevDir, nextDir);
if (angle < bone.minAngle) {
  angle = bone.minAngle + softness * (angle - bone.minAngle);
}
```

**Checklist:**
- Solver walks bone hierarchy correctly
- Constraints enforced per iteration (not post-correction)
- Smooth easing near limits (no snapping)

üîç Validation Prompt: ‚ÄúDrag IK target near joint limit‚Äîdoes joint ease into constraint, not snap?‚Äù

### üîπ Prompt: Connect Graph Metrics to Animation and Solver Outputs

**Assumptions:**
- `<graph-pane>` component is present
- Metrics tracked but not yet bound to FK/IK output

**Goal:** Stream Skeleton and solver metrics into live graph

**Structure:**
- Emit `metricUpdate` events from `Skeleton.updateWorldTransform()` and IK solvers
- Listen in `graph-pane.ts`, update Chart.js datasets on each frame
- Expose export button to dump JSON of all series

**Example:**
```ts
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('metricUpdate', {
  detail: { boneId, time, rotation: bone.worldRotation, length: bone.length }
}));
```

**Checklist:**
- Live graph updates for multiple bones
- Export JSON includes all time-series data
- Minimal performance impact from event streaming

üîç Validation Prompt: ‚ÄúObserve live chart while animating‚Äîdoes graph reflect solver output without lag?‚Äù

### üîπ Prompt: Wire Blend Graph Outputs into Skeleton Preview

**Assumptions:**

- Blend graph UI exists (or is planned)
- Skeleton can accept poses from procedural or keyframe sources

**Goal:** Connect the blend graph output node to drive the skeleton pose in the preview canvas

**Structure:**

- Define a `BlendNode` interface with `getPose(): Pose`
- On each render frame, evaluate the blend graph to produce a `Pose` (rotation and position per bone)
- Call `Skeleton.setPose(pose)` to apply the blended result
- Add a UI toggle to enable/disable blend graph preview

**Example:**

```ts
const pose = blendGraph.evaluate(currentTime);
skeleton.setPose(pose);
```

**Checklist:**

- Blend graph correctly interpolates between FK and IK layers
- Preview updates in response to scrubber or slider changes
- `Skeleton.setPose` applies poses without unwanted side effects

üîç Validation Prompt: ‚ÄúToggle IK and keyframe layers‚Äîdoes the pose update smoothly without jitter or conflict?‚Äù
