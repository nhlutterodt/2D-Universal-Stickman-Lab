# 2D Universal Stickman Lab - Build Instructions

## TypeScript to JavaScript Migration

This project has been successfully migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript for better type safety and development experience.

## Build Process

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm or pnpm

### Building the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Watch mode (for development):**
   ```bash
   npm run build:watch
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start a local server:**
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   cd apps/authoring-ui
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### File Structure

- **Source files**: TypeScript files (`.ts`) in their original locations
- **Compiled files**: JavaScript files (`.js`) in the `dist/` directory
- **HTML references**: Updated to point to compiled `.js` files in `dist/`

### Key Changes Made

1. **Converted all `.js` files to `.ts`** with proper TypeScript types
2. **Updated all imports** to use `.js` extensions for browser compatibility
3. **Fixed TypeScript configuration** to output ES2022 modules
4. **Enhanced Vector2 class** with additional methods (rotate, etc.)
5. **Updated HTML file** to reference compiled JavaScript files
6. **Set up proper build pipeline** with watch mode support

### Browser Compatibility

The compiled JavaScript uses ES2022 features and ES modules, ensuring compatibility with modern browsers while maintaining the original functionality.

### Development Workflow

1. Edit TypeScript files (`.ts`) in their original locations
2. Run `npm run build:watch` to automatically compile changes
3. Refresh the browser to see updates

The TypeScript compiler will catch type errors during development, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.
